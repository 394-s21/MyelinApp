# MyelinMobile

## Description
MyelinMobile is a platform where patients (and their respective caregivers) can interact with their care team to mutually track medical updates and plan appropriate care programs. Patients/caregivers can manage their individual taskboard - adding either pre-built or custom tasks - and care teams can access each of their patient's task boards to manage them accordingly. Additionally, each task board item also includes a messaging board to allow communication between the two different parties.
